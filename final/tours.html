        <h3>Chichen Itza Mayan Ruins</h3>
        <p>A New Seven Wonder of the World. There are some cons to go with the pros when considering a Chichen Itza tour from Playa del Carmen, but the fascinating history, the stunning architecture, and the adventure of it all outweigh things like the heat, a long day, and sometimes insistent vendors.</p>

        <p>During the tour you’ll have the chance to walk around the expansive grounds and learn about the history. Do so! Some people go without a guide, but you simply miss out on too many interesting facts that way. Also, consider bringing umbrellas to shield you from the heat, and a swimsuit to dive into the crystalline waters of an ancient cenote (sinkhole).</p>

        <p>You’ll be treated to a lunch buffet after Chichen Itza and prior to going for a swim in the cenote. Bring some extra snacks just in case for both before and after lunch.</p>
          
        <p>If you do decide to go on your own, your best bet is to rent a jeep from us at SCOOTS in Playa del Carmen and take the toll-road to Chichen Itza. It’s about a 2.5-hour drive.--<a href="https://www.playadelcarmen.com/blog/top-8-playa-del-carmen-day-trips/">READ MORE at Playa Del Carmen.com</a></p>

        <h3>Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve</h3>
        <p>Unless you have your own jeep, the best way to visit the Sian Kaan Biosphere on a short day trip is through an organized tour. You know what that means, rent a jeep from us to get to this incredible reserve and experience the beauty for yourself. </p>

        <p>While you are there, go visit the Mayan ruins of Muyil, take a walk through the jungle, and take a boat ride in the local lagoon before floating down mangrove channels made by the Maya over 1,000 years ago.</p>

        <p>The Sian Ka’an Biosphere is a nature reserve located to the south of Tulum. Established in 1986, one year later the UNESCO named Sian Ka’an as a World Heritage Site. In Yucatec Mayan, Sian Ka’an is translated as “Entrance to the Sky.” Stretching out over almost 75 miles of coastline, the Sian Ka’an Biosphere is also comprised of just under one million acres of land.</p>
          
        <p>To visit the Muyil ruins, you’ll actually take the road to Coba. From Playa del Carmen, it’s about an 80-minute trip. Public transportation is available.--<a href="https://www.playadelcarmen.com/blog/top-8-playa-del-carmen-day-trips/">READ MORE at Playa Del Carmen.com</a></p>
